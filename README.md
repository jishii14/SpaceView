# SpaceView
Website that lets children seamlessly learn about NASA data with just one touch

Space View is an educational application that uses data from NASA's Earth and Mars Rover API's to allow users to develop an interest 
in space exploration by viewing and hearing about some of their publicly-available data.  The application utilizes two 
speech-to-text and text-to-speech API's in order to improve the overall user experience and make viewing NASA's world-class 
images as easy as just saying a few words.
